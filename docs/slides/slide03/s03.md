## Shannon (Information-Theoretic) Security = Perfect Secrecy 

- Basic Idea: Ciphertext should reveal no “information” about Plaintext
  
**Definition**. An encryption over a message space $M$ is perfectly secure if:

$\forall$ probability distribution over $M$

$\forall$ message  $m \in M$

$\forall$ ciphertext $c \in C$ for which $Pr[C=c] > 0$

We have

$ Pr[PT=m|CT=c]  =  Pr[PT=m]$.

###  Explanation of the Definition

- $Pr[PT=m]$ is what the adversary believes the probability that the plaintext is $m$, before seeing the ciphertext
- $Pr[PT=m|CT=c]$ is what the adversary believes after seeing that the ciphertext is $c$
- $Pr[PT=m|CT=c] = Pr[PT=m]$ means that after knowing that the ciphertext is C0, the adversary’s belief does not change. 

### An Equivalent Definition of Perfect Secrecy

**Definition**. An encryption scheme is perfectly secure if and only if **for any ciphertext $c$, and any two plaintext $m1$ and $m2$, the probability that $m1$ is encrypted to $c$ is the same as the probability that $m2$ is encrypted to $c$.**

$\forall$ message $m1$, $m2$

$\forall$ ciphertext $c$

$Pr [CT=c|PT=m1] = Pr[CT=c|PT=m2]$

### Another equivalent definition

An encryption scheme over a message space $M$ is perfectly secure if $\forall$ probability distribution over $M$, the random variables $PT$ and $CT$ are independent. That is,

$\forall$ message $m\in M$

$\forall$ ciphertext $c\in C$

$Pr[PT=m\wedge CT=c]  =  Pr[PT=m] \cdot Pr[CT = c]$

Note that this is equivalent to: When $Pr[CT=c] \neq 0$, we have 

$Pr[PT=m] = Pr [PT=m\wedge CT=c] / Pr[CT=c] = Pr[PT=m|CT=c]$ 

This is also equivalent to: When $Pr[PT=m] \neq 0$, we have 

$Pr[CT=c] = Pr[PT=m\wedge CT=c] / Pr[PT=m] = Pr[CT=c|PT=m]$ 

### Example for Information Theoretical Security

- Consider an example of encrypting the result of a 6-side dice (1 to 6).
    - Method 1: randomly generate K=[1..6], ciphertext is result + K.
        - What is plaintext distribution?  After seeing that the ciphertext is 3, what could be the plaintext.  After seeing that the ciphertext is 12, what could be the plaintext?
    - Method 2: randomly generate K=[1..6], ciphertext is (result + K) mod 6.
        - Same questions.
        - Can one do a brute-force attack?

## Perfect Secrecy

- Fact: When keys are uniformly chosen in a cipher, the cipher has perfect secrecy iff. the number of keys encrypting M to C is the same for any (M,C)
    - This implies that $\forall c \forall m_1 \forall m_2 Pr[CT=c|PT=m1] = Pr[CT=c|PT=m2]$
- One-time pad has perfect secrecy when limited to messages over the same length (Proof?)

### The “Bad News” Theorem for Perfect Secrecy

- Question: OTP requires key as long as messages, is this an inherent requirement for achieving perfect secrecy?
- Answer. Yes. Perfect secrecy implies that key-length $\geq$ msg-length
- Implication: Perfect secrecy difficult to achieve in practice 

Proof:

:::details
Consider one ciphertext C0, for any plaintext M in the plaintext space, there must exist at least one key such that under the key C0 can be decrypted into M.  Furthermore, for any two plaintexts, the corresponding keys must be different, because otherwise, one cannot uniquely decrypt the ciphertext.  Hence, the number of keys must be at least as large as the number of plaintexts.

Consider the plaintext space, ciphertext space, and key space, what relations their sizes must satisfy, for any encryption system?  What about for a system that satisfy perfect secrecy?

## Stream Ciphers

- In One-Time Pad, a key is a random string of length at least the same as the message
- Stream ciphers: 
    - Idea: replace “rand” by “pseudo rand”
    - Use Pseudo Random Number Generator 
    - PRNG: $\{0, 1\}_^{s} \rightarrow \{ 0, 1 \}^{n}$
        - expand a short (e.g., 128-bit) random seed into a long (e.g., 106 bit) string that “looks random”
    - Secret key is the seed
    - Basic encryption method: $E_{key}[M] = M \oplus PRNG(key)$

### Pseudo Random Number Generator

- Useful for cryptography, simulation, randomized algorithm, etc.
    - Stream ciphers, generating session keys
- The same seed always gives the same output stream 
    - *Why is this necessary for stream ciphers?*
- Simulation requires uniform distributed sequences
    - E.g., having a number of statistical properties
- **Cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator** requires unpredictable sequences
    - satisfies the "next-bit test": given consecutive sequence of bits output (but not seed), next bit must be hard to predict
- Some PRNG’s are weak: knowing output sequence of sufficient length, can recover key.  
    - Do not use these for cryptographic purposes

### Randomness and Pseudorandomness 

- For a stream cipher (PRNG) is good, it needs to be "pseudo-random". 
- Random is not a property of one string
    - Is "000000" "less random" than "011001"?
    - Random is the property of a distribution, or a random variable drawn from the distribution 
- Similarly, pseudo-random is property of a distribution
- We say that a distribution $D$ over strings of length-I is pseudorandom if it is **indistinguishable** from a random distribution.
- We use "random string" and "pseudorandom string" as shorthands 

### Distinguisher 

- A distinguisher D for two distributions works as follows: D is given one string sampled from one of the two distributions D tries to guess which distribution it is from D succeeds if guesses correctly

### Pseudorandom Generator Definition

**Definition 3.14**. We say an algorithm $G$, which on input of length $n$ outputs a string of length $l(n)$, is a pseudorandom generator if 

1. For every $n$, $l(n) \ge n$
2. For each PPT distinguisher D, there exists a negligible function negl such that $| Pr[D(r)] = 1 — Pr[D(G(s))=1] | \leq negl(n)$ Where $r$ is chosen at uniformly random from $\{0, 1\}_^{l(n)}$ and $s$ is chosen at uniform random from $\{ 0, 1 \}^{n}$

### Security of using Stream Cipher for Encrpytion 

Consider the construction $\Pi$ of using $G(k) \oplus m$ as the encryption of $m$ 

**Theorem 3.16**. If $G$ is a pseudorandom generator, then $\Pi$ has indistinguishable encryptions in the presence of an eavesdropper. 

*Proof idea?*

:::details
**Them**. $G(k) \oplus m$ is EAV-secure under the assumption that $G$ is a PRG.

**Proof**. If there i s an (...) A that breaks EAV-secure, then we can construct B that breaks "PRG" of G.

**Proof**. A breaks EAV-security with advantage $\epsilon$ (not small)

### Properties of Stream Ciphers

- Typical stream ciphers are very fast
- Widely used, often incorrectly 
    - Content Scrambling System (uses Linear Feedback Shift Registers incorrectly), 
    - Wired Equivalent Privacy (uses RC4 incorrectly)  
    - SSL (uses RC4, SSLv3 has no known major flaw)

### Security Properties of Stream Ciphers

- Under known plaintext, chosen plaintext, or chosen ciphertext, the adversary knows the key stream (i.e., PRNG(key))
    - Security depends on PRNG
    - PRNG must be “unpredictable”
- *Do stream ciphers have perfect secrecy?*
- *How to break a stream cipher in a brute-force way?*
- If the same key stream is used twice, then easy to break.
    - This is a fundamental weakness of stream ciphers; it exists even if the PRNG used in the ciphers is strong

### Using Stream Ciphers in Practice

- If the same key stream is used twice, then easy to break.
    - This is a fundamental weakness of stream ciphers; it exists even if the PRNG used in the ciphers is strong
- In practice, one key is used to encrypt many messages 
    - Example: Wireless communication
    - Solution: Use Initial vectors (IV).
    - $E_key[M] = [IV, M \oplus PRNG(key || IV)]$
        - IV is sent in clear to receiver; 
        - IV needs integrity protection, but not confidentiality protection
        - IV ensures that key streams do not repeat, but does not increase cost of brute-force attacks
        - Without key, knowing IV still cannot decrypt
    - Need to ensure that IV never repeats!
