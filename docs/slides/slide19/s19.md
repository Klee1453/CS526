## 动机

- BLP([Bell–LaPadula模型](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell%E2%80%93LaPadula%E6%A8%A1%E5%9E%8B))关注的是保密性(confidentiality)
- 在大多数系统中，完整性与保密性同样、甚至更加重要
- 数据完整性与系统完整性
    - 数据完整性意味着数据不能在不被发现的情况下被改变

:::tip
在Bell-LaPadula模型中，用户只能在其自己的安全级别或更高的安全级别上创建内容（例如，秘密研究人员可以创建秘密或绝密文件，但不能创建公共文件；**不能下写**）。相反，用户只能查看在其自己的安全级别或更低的安全级别的内容（如，秘密研究人员可以查看公共或秘密文件，但不能查看绝密文件；**不能上读**）

## 什么是系统的完整性(integrity)？

- 目标1：关键数据不改变
- 目标2： 关键数据只能以“正确的方式”改变
    - 例如，在数据库中，完整性约束(integrity constraint)被用于保证一致性
- 目标3：关键数据只通过某些“受信任的程序”进行改变
- 目标4：关键数据只按照被授权用户的意图改变

## [Biba模型](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biba_Model): 完整性等级(Integrity Levels)

- 每个主体（进程）都都有一个完整性等级
- 每个客体都有一个完整性等级
- 完整性等级是具有全序关系的(be totally ordered)
- 完整性等级与保密性保护中的安全等级不同
    - 高度敏感的数据可能具有低完整性
    - 问题：*需要高完整性，但不需要保密性的数据的例子是什么？*

### 严格的完整性政策（与BLP相反）

- 规则：
    - s可以读取o，当且仅当 $i(s) \leq i(o)$，其中， $i(s)$ 表示s（主体）的完整性等级
        - 不能下读
        - 阻止通过被污染的数据进行间接破坏
    - s可以写到o，当且仅当 $i(s) \geq i(o)$
        - 不能上写
        - 阻止直接的恶意修改
        - 固定的完整性等级
        - 没有从低完整性等级客体或主体到高完整性等级客体或主体的信息路径

## 主体的低水位政策(Low-Water Policy)

- 规则：
    - s总是可以读取o，在其读取 $i(s)\leftarrow \min[i(s), i(o)]$ 之后
    - s可以写到o，当且仅当如果 $i(s)\geq i(o)$
- 主体的完整性等级随着阅读低完整性数据而降低
- **没有从低完整性等级的客体到到高完整性等级的客体的信息路径**

## Object Low-Water Mark Policy

- Rules:
    - s can read o; iff $i(s) \leq i(o)$
    - s can always write to o; after writing $i(o)\leftarrow \min[i(s), i(o)]$
- Object’s integrity level decreases as it is contaminated by subjects
- In the end, objects that have high labels have not been contaminated

## Low-Water Mark Integrity Audit Policy

- Rules:
    - s can always read o; after reading $i(s)\leftarrow \min[i(s), i(o)]$
    - s can always write to o; after writing $i(o)\leftarrow \min[i(s), i(o)]$
- Tracing, but not preventing contamination
- Similar to the notion of tainting in software security

## The Ring Policy

- Rules
    - Any subject can read any object
    - s can write to o iff $i(s) \geq i(o)$
- Integrity levels of subjects and objects are fixed.
- Intuitions:
    - subjects are trusted to process low-level inputs correctly

## Five Mandatory Policies in Biba

- Strict integrity policy
- Subject low-water mark policy
- Object low-water mark policy
- Low-water mark Integrity audit policy
- Ring policy
- In practice, one may be using one or more of these policies, possibly applying different policies to different subjects
    - E.g., subjects for which ring policy is applied are trusted to be able to correctly handle inputs

## Object Integrity Levels
- The integrity level of an object may be based on
    - **Quality** of information (levels may change)
        - Degree of trustworthiness
        - Contamination level: 
    - **Importance** of the object (levels do not change)
        - Degree of being trusted
        - Protection level: writing to the objects should be protected
- What should be the relationship between the two meanings, which one should be higher?

## Trusted vs. Trustworthy
- A component of a system is trusted means that 
    - the security of the system depends on it
    - failure of component can break the security policy
    - determined by its role in the system
- A component is trustworthy means that
    - the component deserves to be trusted
    - e.g., it is implemented correctly
    - determined by intrinsic properties of the component

## Integrity vs. Confidentiality

| Confidentiality | Intergrity |
| :-------------: | :--------: |
| Control reading: preserved if confidential info is not read | Control writing: preserved if important obj is not changed |
| For subjects who need to read, control writing after reading is sufficient, no need to trust them | For subjects who need to write, has to trust them, control reading before writing is **not** sufficient |

Integrity requires trust in subjects!

## Analogy

- Confidentiality violation: leak a secret
    - CAN be prevented even if I tell the secret to a person I do not trust, so long as I can lock the person up AFTERWARDS to prevent further leakage
- Integrity violation: follow a wrong instruction
    - CANNOT be prevented if I follow instruction from an person I do not trust even if I lock the person up BEFOREHAND to prevent the person from receiving any malicious instruction
        - The person can invent malicious instruction without 
outside input

## Key Difference between Confidentiality and Integrity

- For confidentiality, controlling reading & writing is sufficient
    - theoretically, no subject needs to be trusted for confidentiality; however, one does need trusted subjects in BLP to make system realistic
- For integrity, controlling reading and writing is insufficient
    - one has to trust all subjects who can write to critical data

## Impacts of The Need to Trust Subjects

- Trusting only a small security kernel is no longer possible
- No need to worry about covert channels for integrity protection
- How to establish trust in subjects becomes a challenge.

## Application of Integrity Protection

- Mandatory Integrity Control in Windows (since Vista)
    - Uses four integrity levels: Low, Medium, High, and System
    - Each process is assigned a level, which limit resources it can access
    - Processes started by normal users have Medium
    - Elevated processes have High
- Through the User Account Control feature
    - Some processes run as Low, such as IE in protected mode
    - Reading and writing do not change the integrity level
        - Ring policy.

## The Clark-Wilson Model

- David D. Clark and David R. Wilson. “A Comparison of Commercial and Military Computer Security Policies.” In IEEE SSP 1987.
    - Military policies focus on preventing disclosure
    - In commercial environment, integrity is paramount
- no user of the system, even if authorized, may be permitted to modify data items in such a way that assets or accounting records of the company are lost or corrupted

## Two High-level Mechanisms for Enforcing Data Integrity

- **Well-formed** transaction
    - a user should not manipulate data arbitrarily, but only in constrained ways that preserve or ensure data integrity
        - e.g., use an append-only log to record all transactions
        - e.g., double-entry bookkeeping
        - e.g., passwd
    - **Can manipulate data only through trusted code!**
- **Separation of duty**
    - ensure external consistency: data objects correspond to the real world objects 
    - separating all operations into several subparts and requiring that each subpart be executed by a different person
    - e.g., the two-man rule

## Implementing the Two High-level Mechanisms

- Mechanisms are needed to ensure
    - **control access to data**: a data item can be manipulated only by a specific set of programs
    - **program certification**: programs must be inspected for proper construction, controls must be provided on the ability to install and modify these programs
    - **control access to programs**: each user must be permitted to use only certain sets of programs
    - **control administration**: assignment of people to programs must be controlled and inspected

## The Clarke-Wilson Model for Integrity

- Unconstrained Data Items (UDIs)
    - data with low integrity
- Constrained Data Items (CDIs)
    - data items within the system to which the integrity model must apply
- Integrity Verification Procedures (IVPs)
    - confirm that all of the CDIs in the system conform to the integrity specification
- Transformation Procedures (TPs)
    - well-formed transactions

## Differences from MAC/BLP

- A data item is not associated with a particular security level, but rather with a set of TPs 
- A user is not given read/write access to data items, but rather permissions to execute certain programs

## Comparison with Biba

- Biba lacks the procedures and requirements on identifying subjects as trusted
- Clark-Wilson focuses on how to ensure that programs can be trusted

## The Chinese Wall Security Policy

- Goal: **Avoid Conflict of Interest**
- Data are stored in a hierarchical arranged system
    - the lowest level consists of individual data items
    - the intermediate level group data items into company data sets
    - the highest level group company datasets whose corporation are in competition

## Simple Security Rule in Chinese Wall Policy

- Access is only granted if the object requested:
    - is in the same company dataset as an object already accessed by that subject, i.e., within the Wall, or
    - belongs to an entirely different conflict of interest class.
